# lego-ization
Lego-ization of images using CycleGAN!
Team members: Caroline Zhang (czhang157), Trey Wiedmann (twiedman)
You can download the numpy arrays generated from our training/testing images here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0kcTG2lT9ZHDWIuqPFozJjz_-fgNH3v?usp=sharing. This folder also contains all of our training/testing images. The numpy arrays are needed to run train.py . To generate an image use generate.py . Models saved at different epochs are in the Models folder.
Also, please note that a good amount of the arrays failed to upload to google drive. If you would like to download all of the arrays, you can access them on this branch: https://github.com/carolinebzhang/lego-ization/tree/all_arrays . You don't need the images to run any of the training/generating code. 

Packages required to run this project inlcude the most recent versions of:
- PyTorch and torcheval
- Numpy
- PIL
- Skimage
