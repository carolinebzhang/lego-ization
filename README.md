Lego-ization of images using CycleGAN!

You can download the numpy arrays generated from our training/testing images here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0kcTG2lT9ZHDWIuqPFozJjz_-fgNH3v?usp=sharing. This folder also contains all of our training/testing images. The numpy arrays are needed to run train.py . To generate an image use generate.py . Models saved at different epochs are in the Object-Object models folder and the Scene-Scene models folder. 
Also, please note that a good amount of the arrays failed to upload to google drive. If you would like to download all of the arrays, you can access them on this branch: https://github.com/carolinebzhang/lego-ization/tree/all_arrays . You don't need the images to run any of the training/generating code.
